JavaScript API practice projects and experiments

**JS_API_Lab**

Welcome to JS_API_Lab — my personal playground for experimenting with APIs using JavaScript.

This repository is where I test, break, fix, and understand how APIs really work. Instead of just watching tutorials, I build small hands-on projects to learn things properly.

If you're also learning JavaScript and want practical API examples, you might find something useful here.

**Current Project: random-user-details**

This folder contains a small project built in vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks) that fetches random user data from:

https://randomuser.me/

It retrieves real-time user data and displays meaningful information about a randomly generated person.

> **What It Does**

Fetches random user data using fetch()

Parses JSON response

_Displays_:

Full Name

Email

Location (City & Country)

Profile Picture

Handles asynchronous JavaScript properly

Updates the UI dynamically

> **Tech Used**

HTML5

CSS3

Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

Fetch API

Public API: randomuser.me

No frameworks. No libraries. Just raw JavaScript.

> **Why This Exists**

I'm currently building my JavaScript skills deeper — especially working with:

APIs

Async / Await

Promises

JSON parsing

DOM manipulation

Error handling

Instead of jumping straight into frameworks like React, I'm making sure I understand the fundamentals first.

This repo will grow over time with more API experiments.

> **How To Run**

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/JS_API_Lab.git

Open the random-user-details folder

Open index.html in your browser

That's it.

No installations needed.

> **What I Learned From This Project**

How APIs actually return structured data

How to safely extract nested properties

How to avoid breaking when data isn't immediately available

How asynchronous code flows in real projects

How simple JavaScript can still build dynamic interfaces

**Future Experiments**

Some ideas I plan to explore inside this repo:

Weather API

Movie database API

News API

GitHub profile fetcher

Currency exchange API

This repo is basically my API gym.

> **Contributions**

This is mainly a personal learning lab, but feel free to:

Suggest improvements

Point out better practices

Share ideas for APIs to experiment with.
